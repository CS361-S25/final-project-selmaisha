Parasite thoughts:
- Can each org only solve one task at a time? If not, the task check logic has to change
- Where do we initialize the parasites? We need to set their virulence
- Where do we try to kill them? Do we do this right? Do we kill the right ones?
- CheckOutput - the same one is called for both org and parasite now. 
    And the checkoutput is called from instructions that I don't really understand so I don't know how to change it
    If we are working with the same CheckOutput we currently have an issue - parasites will get points for solving tasks
    that are not the same as the org, and then get points again later.
    We need the checkoutput call to set the instance variables of the parasite,
    but not deal w points yet
- CheckOutput: can we only set task vars there, and then give them points for it later?
- I have been thinking about injecting parasites. We need to wait a while to do it, because our orgs need to be able to solve tasks first. 
    Also, parasites must be able to solve a task when they are injected, if not they won't be able to survive to evolve tasks
- Since parasites can't exist without a host, I think it makes sense to store parasites as org instance variables instead of as a separate vector.
    Then, we should make a new class host that inherits from org, and is the same but has an extra instance variable parasite. And then we 
    use this class instead of org everywhere.
