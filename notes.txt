Issue thoughts:
- Can each org only solve one task at a time? If not, the task check logic has to change
    - I think this is a faulty assumption. So task check (both parasites and color - give color to represent the hardest task) need to change
- Also, why are there parasites right away - they should be initialized later. Ask Isha about how that works currently
- I want to reset the task flags after every single update - because an organism CAN solve a task doesn't mean it does it.
- I want to set a probability that orgs are initialized with nand - shoudld we also give fewer points for nand to encourage diversity
- I think a mixed grid is more interesting
- I think we should create a random schedule of the hosts when we loop over places we can inject parasites
- Should we kill only those hosts with 0 points even though they have gone a while without reproducing?
    - I implemented this
- I ran web with the following settings:
    - numstart 30
    - mutrate 0.02
    - reward 10
    - numboxes 32
    - lifespan 1000
    I then let it run - it was completely stationary until about 800 updates, when it started moving. Why is this happening?
- In native now there are two ways of initially injecting organisms. In theory I think they should be the same, but one works and the other leads to a population that dies out
    I don't know why this is happening. In web we use the second method and it works well so this is confusing
    It might be because the random injection might overwrite other orgs, so we can fix that. But for now the sequential one works well.
- I ended up setting popstruct.mixed instead of grid so organisms dont keep reproducing on top of their old offspring which just kills of task solvers


Newer thoughts:
- Should we reset the flags between each time? 
    If we use them to determine parasite points, then yes, we should. But I think the diversity
    should be calculated based on how many orgs can solve a task, not how many did it in this update
    - If we use them at all to inject parasites we should also not reset them, as parasites should be injected where a host is even 
        just capabple of solving a task

SO NEXT STEP: Either don't clear task flags, or fix injection logic. Check points logic to figure out which one is easier to do.
Also double check how parasite reproduction works
